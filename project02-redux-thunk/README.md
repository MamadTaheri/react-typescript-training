# Redux Basic Project

## What we need?

-  Install packages (redux)(react-redux)
-  Action (names)
-  Action Creators
-  Reducer
-  Store
-  Provider (with store)
-  Use redux hooks to work with redux (useSelector, useDispatch)

-  Multiple Reducers (beacuse we have different states)

- Added Redux-Thunk
